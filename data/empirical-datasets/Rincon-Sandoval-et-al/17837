This repository contains data and trees associated with the article:

Rincon-Sandoval M, Betancur-R R, Maldonado-Ocampo J.A.
Comparative Phylogeography of Trans-Andean Freshwater Fishes Based on Genome-Wide Nuclear 
and Mitochondrial Markers

The file library_samples_otophysi.csv contains sample information including: locality, 
associated specimen and tissues number, and data availability information.

The file target_capture.csv contains target capture information showing total length of 
the alignments by individuals, number of loci and locus length.

The file mitogenomes.csv contains mitogenome information by individuals with the 
respective sequence length in base pairs.

Additionally, there are four directories, containing data and trees

1. Master Reference: contains a fasta file with the master references of Danio rerio

2. Alignments: contains two nexus files with the concatenated datasets including 
   partitions for exon loci and mitochondrial DNA.
   
3. BPP: contains information about 70 random loci utilized in each analysis and seven 
   libraries (a library by species) containing information about every random analysis
   
4. SNPs: contains three libraries
   SNAPP contains SNPs alignment in fasta file and a xml file by species
   STRUCTURE contains structure project data and a joblist file by species 
   SVD contains nexus files of unlinked SNPs with the taxpartitions 
   
5. Trees: contains three libraries 
   BI contains bayesian trees inferred from mitogenomic DNA
   PCF contains species trees inferred with *BEAST and SNAPP used as input data for
   PCF analyses
   RAxML contains maximum likelihood trees inferred from concatenated nuclear loci and
   mitogenomic DNA.
