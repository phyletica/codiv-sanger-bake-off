Simulation-based analyses
#########################

As described in the
:ref:`background` and :ref:`eco-configs` sections,
we will be simulating datasets ...

We will use ``simcoevolity`` to simulate these datasets in a format ready to
analyze with ``ecoevolity``.
We will generate scripts in the ``scripts/simcoevolity-scripts`` directory that
will run these simulations in batches of manageable numbers of replicates.


Setup our environment
=====================

Before anything else, navigate to the project directory (if you are not already
there)::

    cd /path/to/your/copy/of/codiv-sanger-bake-off

If you are working on AU's Hopper cluster, this will be::

    cd /scratch/YOUR-AU-USERNAME/codiv-sanger-bake-off

If you haven't already, let's activate the Python virutal environment for this
project::

    source pyenv/bin/activate


Create simulation scripts
=========================

Now, lets ``cd`` into the project's ``scripts`` directory::

    cd scripts

Use the ``create_new_batch_of_simcoevolity-scripts.py`` Python script to create
simcoevolity scripts for generating a new batch of 10 simulated datasets for
each of the 5 models (ecoevolity config files)::

    python create_new_batch_of_simcoevolity_scripts.py ../configs/*.yml

The output should confirm the creation of 12 new scripts for running
``simcoevolity`` (one for each config in ``configs``), and report a
batch ID::

    Script written to '/home/jamie/Dropbox/projects/codiv-sanger-bake-off/scripts/simcoevolity-scripts/fixed-independent-pairs-05-sites-00500-locus-500-batch-266950032.sh'

    Simcoevolity scripts successfully written.
    
    Batch ID:
    	266950032

But, your batch ID number should be different.

**IMPORTANT: Make a note of your batch ID number, you will need it moving forward.**
For all of the commands below, use your batch ID number in place of
``266950032``.

Commit simulation scripts
-------------------------

Before we run the ``simcoevolity`` scripts, let's add them to the staging area
of project Git repository::

    git add simcoevolity-scripts/*266950032.sh

Then, commit them to the repository::

    git commit

A good commit message might look something like::

    Adding batch 266950032 of simcoevolity scripts.

    Adding shell scripts generated by:
    
        create_new_batch_of_simcoevolity-scripts.py
    
    These scripts will run simcoevolity to generate a batch of 20
    simulated datasets.

Lastly, push the new scripts to the remote repository hosted on a |github|_::

    git push origin main

If you get a message that looks something like::

    ! [rejected]        main -> main (fetch first)
    error: failed to push some refs to '/home/jamie/git-fun/local1/../remote'
    hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
    hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
    hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
    hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

**OR** a more cryptic message that looks something like (it's more cryptic due
to Git LFS)::

    ref main:: Error in git rev-list --stdin --objects --not --remotes=origin --: exit status 128 fatal: bad object 19dd47de1e8368e425ffbec1a00c8f500f76976a

This simply means that your copy of the project repository is behind the copy
on GitHub (i.e., someone else has pushed since you last pulled).
This is not problem, all you need to do is ``pull`` to update your copy::

    git pull origin main

This will likely create a new commit that merges the updates on GitHub with
your new content.
This is common, and Git will create a default commit message for you.
After you save and close the commit message, the new merged commit will be
finalized.
Then you should be able to ``push``::

    git push origin main


Run simulation scripts
======================

Next, ``cd`` into the ``simcoevolity-scripts`` directory::
    
    cd simcoevolity-scripts

If you are working on AU's Hopper cluster, use a for loop to submit the five
``simcoevolity`` scripts to the queue::

    for script_path in *266950032.sh; do ../../bin/psub "$script_path"; done

.. note:: If you are working on a different cluster, you will need
    to either update the ``../../bin/psub`` to work for your system,
    or replace ``../../bin/psub`` with whatever command is used on your
    cluster to submit jobs.

    If you are not on a cluster, you can simply run the scripts directly::

        for script_path in *266950032.sh; do bash "$script_path"; done

After submitting the scripts with the for loop, go ahead and ``cd`` out of the
``simcoevolity-scripts`` directory, which will put you back up in the
``scripts`` directory::

    cd ..

Assuming you are on the Hopper cluster, you can monitor the progress of
the jobs by using::

    qstat

When the jobs are waiting in queue to start, the output will look like::

    Job ID                    Name             User            Time Use S Queue
    ------------------------- ---------------- --------------- -------- - -----

    1942034.hopper-mgt         ...-266950032.sh jro0014                0 Q general        
    .
    .
    .

When the jobs are running, the output will look like::
        
    Job ID                    Name             User            Time Use S Queue
    ------------------------- ---------------- --------------- -------- - -----

    1942031.hopper-mgt         ...-266950032.sh jro0014         00:00:19 R general

    .
    .
    .

When the jobs are complete, the output will *briefly* look like (after a few
minutes of being complete, the jobs will disappear from the output of
``qstat``)::

    Job ID                    Name             User            Time Use S Queue
    ------------------------- ---------------- --------------- -------- - -----

    1942031.hopper-mgt         ...-266950032.sh jro0014         00:00:42 C general        
    1942032.hopper-mgt         ...-266950032.sh jro0014         00:00:23 C general

    1942034.hopper-mgt         ...-266950032.sh jro0014         00:00:23 C general        
    .
    .
    .


What each of these ``simcoevolity`` scripts does is:

1.  Use the ``simcoevolity`` tool to simulate datasets and output them into a
    ``simulations`` directory in the project directory.
2.  For each simulated dataset, the script generates 4 Bash
    scripts for analyzing the respective dataset 4 times with ``ecoevolity``
    (i.e., four independent MCMC chains for each analysis).

All of the files created during these 2 steps are output into
a ``simulations`` directory in the project directory.
If you are still in the ``scripts`` directory, you can list the contents of
this directory using::

    ls ../simulations

This should show 12 directories, one for each config file in ``configs``::

    fixed-independent-pairs-05-sites-00500-locus-500
    fixed-independent-pairs-05-sites-01000-locus-500
    fixed-independent-pairs-05-sites-02500-locus-500
    fixed-independent-pairs-05-sites-10000-locus-500
    fixed-simultaneous-pairs-05-sites-00500-locus-500
    fixed-simultaneous-pairs-05-sites-01000-locus-500
    fixed-simultaneous-pairs-05-sites-02500-locus-500
    fixed-simultaneous-pairs-05-sites-10000-locus-500
    pairs-05-sites-00500-locus-500
    pairs-05-sites-01000-locus-500
    pairs-05-sites-02500-locus-500
    pairs-05-sites-10000-locus-500

Let's look into the first one::

    ls ../simulations/fixed-independent-pairs-05-sites-00500-locus-500

You should see a directory associated with *your* batch number (your number
will be different from mine)::

    batch-266950032

If you look in this directory::

    ls ../simulations/fixed-independent-pairs-05-sites-00500-locus-500/batch-266950032

You will see a very long list of files, so I won't show the output here.
For each ``simcoevolity`` simulation replicate there are:

*   5 data files (one for each of the pairs of populations). The names of
    these files end with "``chars.txt``".
*   1 file containing the true values of all the parameters that
    ``simcoevolity`` used to simulate the data files. These files end with
    "``-true-values.txt``".
*   1 ecoevolity config files.
    These files end with "``-config.yml``"
*   4 Bash scripts for analyzing the dataset with ``ecoevolity``.
    I.e., four independent analyses (MCMC chains) for each dataset.
    These files end with "``-qsub.sh``"
    

Analyzing simulated data
========================

Next, we need to run all those Bash scripts to analyze each simulated
dataset with ``ecoevolity`` four times.
Given that we simulated 20 datasets under 12 different settings and we will
analyze each dataset 4 times, this will be :math:`20 \times 12 \times 4 = 960`
``ecoevolity`` analyses.

If you are on the Hopper cluster, we will use a script that will run all of
these analyses as a single job array.
Hopper imposes a limit of 500 jobs per user, so we will use the job array to
run only 400 of these analyses at a time, and cycle through them until they are
all done.

.. note:: If you are **not** on the Hopper cluster, the ``submit_sim_analyses.sh``
    script we use below will not work on your system.
    You will either need to update that script to work with your system,
    or simply submit all theses analyses "manually."
    This can be done easily with a for loop. For example::

        for script_path in ../simulations/*/batch-266950032/*qsub.sh; do echo "$script_path"; done

    Just change "echo" to whatever command is necessary to submit jobs on your
    system (and remember your batch ID number is different).


To do this, make sure you are in the ``scripts`` directory of the project and
enter::

    bash submit_sim_analyses.sh ../simulations/*/batch-266950032

This will produce a lot of output similar to (but with many more lines in place
of the ellipses)::

    2059031[].hopper-mgt

Why all the output complaining about "``No stdout``"?
Well, this script first looks for the results of all the analyses, and only
runs the analyses for the scripts that lack complete results (all of them in
our case, since we are running them for the first time).
This allows us to re-run this script after all the analyses are finished, and
it will re-run any analyses that failed
(Hopper has a depressingly high rate of job failures).

On hopper you can monitor the job array using::

    qstat

which shows the status of the entire job array on one line::

    Job ID                    Name             User            Time Use S Queue

To see the individuals jobs within the array, use::

    qstat -t

which will show the full list of jobs in the array that are running or waiting
to run::

    Job ID                    Name             User            Time Use S Queue

    ...

This list will be longer than 400 jobs, but the job array will make sure at
most 400 run at any given time.
It will also be shorter than the total number of jobs in the array (1200),
because the array will keep adding them into the wait list as it cycles through
all the analyses.

If you just want to know how many jobs are actively running, you can
pipe the output of ``qstat -t`` to ``grep`` and then to ``wc``::
    
    qstat -t | grep -i "R gen" | wc -l

My output was::

    239

So, 239 of my analyses are currently running.
You can change this to get the number of jobs the array
currently has waiting to run::

    qstat -t | grep -i "Q gen" | wc -l

Note, the number output from this command might not be all the jobs left to
run, because the job array may not have put all the jobs in the queue yet.

The job array will create a lot of output files in your ``scripts`` directory.
If all is working well, you can get rid of these using the following command
from within the ``scripts`` directory of the project::

    rm spawn_job_array.o*-*

If all is *not* going well, these output files might have content to help
you figure out what the problem is.

Once the ``qstat -t`` command is showing that all of your analyses have finished,
run the same command from within your ``scripts`` directory again::

    bash submit_sim_analyses.sh ../simulations/*/batch-266950032

.. note:: Only re-run this command *after* all the analyses started
    by this command the first time are no longer running.
    In other words, the ``qstat -t`` should produce no output (assuming you are
    not running analyses for other projects) before you re-run this command.

If most of your analyses finished successfully, the script will seem like
it's running slow.
Just be patient; it is checking the output of all the analyses, and only writes
a message to the screen if it finds an analysis that didn't finish
successfully.
So, if it seems like nothing is happening, that's a good thing (i.e., the
script is finding lots of successfully completed analyses).
Here is my output from the ``submit_sim_analyses.sh`` script::

This output is telling me that three of the analyses (of the 960 I submitted
the first time) did not finish (their standard output was either missing or
incomplete).
The output also confirms that these failed analyses are being re-run with a new
job array.
Again, you can monitor the progress of your re-analyses using ``qstat -t``,
and once they finish, go ahead and run the following command for the 
third time (from within the ``scripts`` directory)::

    bash submit_sim_analyses.sh ../simulations/*/batch-266950032

Hopefully the third time (and if your lucky, the second time), your output will
look like::

    All analyses are complete and clean!

This confirms that all of your analyses have successfully finished!
Note, the job failure rate of the Hopper cluster
fluctuates.
So, you might have some failures that get resubmitted during your third use
of ``submit_sim_analyses.sh`` above.
If so, just monitor those re-runs with ``qstat -t``, and run the
``submit_sim_analyses.sh`` script again after they finished (as we did three
times above).
Eventually, you should get the ``All analyses are complete and clean!``
message.

.. note:: Analyses that need to be re-run are done so exactly (i.e., the
    exact same data and starting seed for the random number generator).

    These jobs are not failing due to any issues with |eco|_.
    Our cluster almost always has some small failure rate when running lots of
    jobs, no matter how simple the jobs are.
    So, we can simply run them again, exactly as before, and they will work
    fine.

    I say this, because if we were re-running analyses with different simulated
    datasets or different starting seeds, we could be creating subtle biases in
    our analyses.
    That is not the case here.
    We are only re-running analyses because our cluster's queue/scheduler
    system is ... less than ideal.

Go ahead and clean out all the output files from the job array from inside the
``scripts`` directory::

    rm spawn_job_array.o*-*


Summarizing the results
=======================

After the 
``submit_sim_analyses.sh`` script confirms that ``All analyses are complete
and clean!``
it is time for us to summarize the results from all 960 analyses we ran.
Our results are currently scattered across 960 log files output by
``ecoevolity`` during these analyses.
These log files contain MCMC samples collected from the posterior distribution
of the model given the simulated dataset.
We will use the Python script ``scripts/parse_sim_results.py`` to parse all
these log files (posterior samples) and summarize them in tab-delimited tables.
We will run the ``parse_sim_results.py`` Python script using the
``parse_sim_results.sh`` Bash script, so that we can submit it as a job to the
queue.
Assuming you are on the Hopper cluster and in the ``scripts`` directory of your
copy of the project, let's use a for-loop to parse the results for each of the
12 config files simultaneously::

    for batch_dir in ../simulations/*/batch-266950032; do ../bin/psub parse_sim_results.sh "$batch_dir"; done
    

.. note:: If you are not on the Hopper cluster, you can simply run the Python
    script directly::

        python parse_sim_results.py ../simulations/*/*266950032

    Just make sure you have the project's Python virtual environment
    environment activated.

Use the ``qstat`` command to monitor the progress of the parsing jobs.
Once the output of ``qstat`` confirms the jobs have finished running,
we can take a look at all the tab-delimited text files it created
that summarize all the results::

    ls ../simulations/*/batch-266950032/*results.tsv

You will notice that each ``batch`` directory of simulations has its own
``simcoevolity-results.tsv`` file.
Each one contains the results summarized for 20 datasets simulated according to
the settings (i.e., model and dataset size) specified in the corresponding
ecoevolity config file.
Each line of these files summarizes the results for one of the simulation
replicates.
So each of these files should have 21 lines (20 lines of results, plus a line
with the column headers).
We can easily confirm this using ``wc``::

    wc -l ../simulations/*/batch-266950032/*results.tsv

Now, let's ``gzip`` these files::
      
    gzip ../simulations/*/batch-266950032/*results.tsv

Now, add them to the staging area of the project Git repository::

    git add ../simulations/*/batch-266950032/*results.tsv.gz

And, commit them to the repository database::

    git commit

A good commit message might look something like::

    Adding batch 266950032 of simulation results.

    Adding gzipped, tab-delimited files. Each file summarizes the results of
    ecoevolity analyses of 20 simcoevolity simulation replicates.  Adding
    results of simulations of 4 different dataset sizes simulated under 3
    models (DPP, independent divergences, and simultaneous divergence); all
    datasets were analyzed with the same model (DPP).
    

.. note:: Git handles the versioning of text files very well, but not zipped
    files. So, we usually want to avoid adding zipped files to a Git
    repository. If we have large files we want to keep in a Git repo, it's
    better to use an extension like `Git LFS <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_.

    However, in this case we are adding files that we never want to version
    control (we shouldn't be editing our results files!). So, it is not a
    problem that Git will not be able to track line-by-line changes to these
    files.

Finally, push your new results to the remote repository hosted on a |github|_
server::

    git push origin main

If you get a "rejected" or "error" message, your copy of the repository is most
likely behind the remote copy on GitHub.
You will need to ``pull`` before you ``push``.
:ref:`See here for more details <pushing-from-behind>`.


Cleaning up
===========

After we have committed and pushed the results of our analyses, let's use a
for-loop to cleanup all those thousands of files that were generated during the
simulations and analyses::

    for batch_dir in ../simulations/*/batch-266950032; do ../bin/psub archive_sim_files.sh "$batch_dir"; done

This for loop runs the ``archive_sim_files.sh`` script on each of the
directories containing your batch of simulation files.
The ``archive_sim_files.sh`` script copies these files into compressed archives
and removes the original files.

Now, we can add these archives to the git repository::

    git add ../simulations/*/batch-266950032/*.tar.xz

And, commit them to the repository database::

    git commit

A good commit message might look something like::

    Adding archives of sim files for batch 266950032.

    Adding compressed archives of all the ``simcoevolity`` and
    ``ecoevolity`` files for batch 266950032 of simulation replicates.
    These files are handled by Git LFS, so only a reference to the
    files is stored in the git database.

.. note:: As discussed above, Git handles the versioning of text files very
    well, but not large, compressed files like the ones we just added.
    So, why did we add them? Well, we have configured
    `Git LFS <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_.
    to handle any files that end with "``.tar.xz``" (this configuration is in
    the ``.gitattributes`` file in the base directory of the project).

    Git LFS works by only storing references to these files, rather than the
    files themselves. So, ``git`` doesn't track the contents of these large,
    compressed files. Which is good for us; we aren't going to be making edits
    to these files, and it would slow git down to always be checking these
    files for changes.

Finally, push everything to the remote repository on |github|_::

    git push origin main

If you get a "rejected" or "error" message, your copy of the repository is most
likely behind the remote copy on GitHub.
You will need to ``pull`` before you ``push``.

Reflection
==========

That's it!
You've just contributed a batch of simulation-based analyses to this project.
Take a moment to reflect on what you did and why
(the :ref:`background` and :ref:`eco-configs` sections might help for this).
Can you think of other models or simulation conditions that would be good to
explore for this project?
